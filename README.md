# Frosty (working title)
A news reader with productivity enhancements.

## Backend
This is in its earliest stages. Right now, the server uses Hono with Bun's SQLite. It may not stay that way. I might use Go.

## Frontend
I don't think this app will have heavy enough interactivity to warrant a front-end framework, so I'm probably going to default to SSR with some HTMX (and maybe Alpine) thrown in. That could change.
